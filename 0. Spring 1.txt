Project  = Business Logic + Common Login 

Framework  provides Common Logic .
Ex . Capture form data .
     Validate data form .
     Create Connection Pool .
     DB Crud operation .

Application Architecture 
=========================

project : Collection of Programs

Project = FrontEnd  + Backend + Database

 Backend = Web Layer(REST APIs) + Business Layer + Integration Layer + DAO Layer

 Database = Persitent Store 

Architecture 
=============

Monolith and Microservices architecture .



================================================================================
1. Spring Core : It is base module in the spring framework 

   => Spring core module providing fundamental concepts of Spring Framework 

	1) IOC Container
	2) Dependency Injection
	3) Bean Life Cycle
	4) Bean Scopes
	5) Autowiring 

2. Spring Context : It will deal with configuration required for our Spring Application 

3. Spring AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming 

		=> Aop is used to separate business logic and Secondary Logic 
		  ex : Security , Logging, Auditing, Exception Handling...
		  

   Note : if we combine businees logic and Secondary logic then it will be difficult to maintain .


4. Spring JDBC : It is used to simplify database Communication logic.
	> In java jdbc we need to write boiler plate code .
	> Using SPring JDBC we can directly execute query the remaining part JDBC will take care

5. Spring Web MVC : It is used to develop both Web Application & Distributed application 
	> Web Application
	> Distributed Application 


5. Spring ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
	=> Spring Framework Having integration with ORM frameworks
	EX : Spring ORM, Spring DATA JPA

6. Spring Security 
	=> Using Spring Security we can implement Authentication & 		 Authorization .
	=> Spring Security with OAuth2.0 

7. Spring Batch : Batch means bulk operation 
	=> It provide service registry to register all our microsevices.
