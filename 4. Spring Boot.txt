============
Spring Boot
============

=> SpringBoot is one apporoach to develop Spring Based application less configuration .

	Spring Boot = SpringFramework - XML configuration

=> Spring is not replacement for spring framework. Boot developed on top of Spring Framework .

Note : all spring framework concepts can be used in spring Boot also .

===========================
Advantages of Spring Boot
===========================

1. Less Configuration

2. Pom Starters .

	Ex: web-starter, jpa-starter, security-starter, mail-starter.

3. AutoConfiguration .

4. Embedded Server (Ex: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty)

5. Actuators( production Ready features )


Spring Boot Application Folder Structure
=========================================

src/main/java : To keep our source code
	
	- Application.java : It is start class of the Spring boot(main class)

src/main/resources : To keep project configuration files 

	- application.properties/yml

src/test/java : to keep junit code( Unit testing )

	- ApplicationTest.java

src/test/resources : Unit testing related config files goes here .

Maven Dependencies : Downloaded jars will be available here .

pom.xml : Maven configuration file( dependencies ).



=======================
Spring Boot Start Class
=======================

package in.learn;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

}


=> It is entrypoint for spring boot application execution .

=> @SpringBootApplication is equal to below 3 annotation .
	
	@SpringBootConfiguration
	@EnableAutoConfiguration
	@COmponentScan


=> Spring Boot start class will act as configuration class because of @SpringBootConfiguration annotation

=> In spring boot applicataion auto configuration feature will be available of @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation.

=> Component Scan will be performed in spring boot because of @ComponentScan annotation . 


==========================================
What is SpringApplication.run() method
==========================================

=> Spring Boot start class main() method will call SpringApplication.run() method.

=> SpringApplication.run() is entry point for boot application execution. This run() method will return refernece of IOC


==========================
Runners in spring boot
==========================

=>Runners are used to execute the logic only once when application got started .

=> SpringApplication.run() method will call runners .

=> In Spring Boot we have 2 types of runners .

	1. Application Runner 
	2. CommandLine Runner

=> Runner is used to fetch data from the database and store it in the cache .

=> pre requisiting :
   ================

 1. Json 
 2. java restful services
 3. Spring Core, Spring Boot

==========================
properties and yaml files 
==========================

=>properties file is used to configure properties in linear structure 

	Ex: server.port = 8080

=>YML file is used to configure properties in hieraricahl structure 

	EX : server :
		  port : 8080



=> In properties , for every profile separate properties file should be created .
